                        Nothing but Nutrition is a Flask web application designed to help users gain informative nutritional data about their foods.
                        Through the OpenFoodFacts API and libraries such as OpenCV and Pyzbar, users scan UPC barcodes with their camera and receive clear,
                        organized information in return.

                        This project was inspired by my interest in health and learning more about APIs.
                        As my first experience with them, I gained valuable knowledge in server requests and parsing JSON data,
                        as well as familiarizing myself with new libraries.
