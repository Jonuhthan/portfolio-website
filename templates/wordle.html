                    <p>
                        Since its release in 2021, Wordle has been a part of my daily routine. Still learning Python at the time, I decided to combine my two interests
                        and create my own little representation of the game. This project works by outsourcing two CSV files, a word bank and a list of valid words,
                        and getting user input. Players are prompted six times to guess a 5-letter word, receiving colored hints about the orientation of the
                        letters. The program checks for the frequencies of each letter and highlights their status accordingly. 
                    </p>
